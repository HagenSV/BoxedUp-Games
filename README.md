# About
BoxedUp Games is a collection of party games similar to jackbox, but with one major difference: the game can only be played by players on the same network, due to technical and financial limitations.
Despite this limitation, the game is will still be able to thrive with its target audience, college students, who will play in person on a shared network.

## Explain Yourself
Go head to head against your friends to see which of you can come up for the best explaination for the situation you're in. 

Each player will be given two prompts (and each prompt will ge given to two players) stating the situation they are currently in, they must answer the prompt explaining how they got there. Once everyone has answered their prompt, or the time has run out, players will then vote on their favorite response to each situation.
